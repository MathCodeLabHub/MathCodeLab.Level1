## üî¢ Basic List Operations

### Problem 1: Sum of Numbers
**Question:** Find the sum of all numbers in a list without using `sum()`.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

total = 0
for num in numbers:
    total = total + num

print("Sum:", total)
```

**Output:** `Sum: 150`

**Explanation:**
- Start with `total = 0`
- Add each number one by one
- 0 + 10 = 10, 10 + 20 = 30, 30 + 30 = 60, 60 + 40 = 100, 100 + 50 = 150

---

### Problem 2: Find Average
**Question:** Calculate the average without using `sum()` or `len()`.

**Solution:**
```python
scores = [85, 92, 78, 95, 88]

# Calculate sum
total = 0
for score in scores:
    total = total + score

# Count items
count = 0
for score in scores:
    count = count + 1

# Calculate average
average = total / count

print("Average:", average)
```

**Output:** `Average: 87.6`

**Explanation:**
- First, add all numbers: 85 + 92 + 78 + 95 + 88 = 438
- Then, count items: 5
- Finally, divide: 438 √∑ 5 = 87.6

---

### Problem 3: Product of All Numbers
**Question:** Find the product of all numbers (multiply them).

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]

product = 1  # Start with 1, not 0!
for num in numbers:
    product = product * num

print("Product:", product)
```

**Output:** `Product: 120`

**Explanation:**
- Start with `product = 1` (if you start with 0, everything becomes 0!)
- Multiply each number: 1 √ó 2 = 2, 2 √ó 3 = 6, 6 √ó 4 = 24, 24 √ó 5 = 120

---

### Problem 4: Count Items in List
**Question:** Count how many items are in a list without using `len()`.

**Solution:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]

count = 0
for fruit in fruits:
    count = count + 1

print("Total items:", count)
```

**Output:** `Total items: 4`

**Explanation:**
- Start with `count = 0`
- Add 1 for each item in the list

---

## üîç Finding Min/Max

### Problem 5: Find Minimum
**Question:** Find the smallest number without using `min()`.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]

minimum = numbers[0]  # Start with first number

for num in numbers:
    if num < minimum:
        minimum = num

print("Minimum:", minimum)
```

**Output:** `Minimum: 9`

**Explanation:**
- Assume first number (45) is smallest
- Compare each number and update if smaller
- 12 < 45, so minimum = 12
- 9 < 12, so minimum = 9 (final answer)

---

### Problem 6: Find Maximum
**Question:** Find the largest number without using `max()`.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]

maximum = numbers[0]  # Start with first number

for num in numbers:
    if num > maximum:
        maximum = num

print("Maximum:", maximum)
```

**Output:** `Maximum: 78`

**Explanation:**
- Assume first number (45) is largest
- Compare each number and update if larger
- 78 > 45, so maximum = 78 (remains largest)

---

### Problem 7: Find Both Min and Max in One Loop
**Question:** Find both smallest and largest using a single loop.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]

minimum = numbers[0]
maximum = numbers[0]

for num in numbers:
    if num < minimum:
        minimum = num
    if num > maximum:
        maximum = num

print("Minimum:", minimum)
print("Maximum:", maximum)
```

**Output:**
```
Minimum: 9
Maximum: 78
```

**Explanation:**
- Initialize both with first element
- Check both conditions in the same loop
- More efficient than two separate loops

---

### Problem 8: Find Second Largest
**Question:** Find the second largest number without sorting.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 56, 89]

largest = numbers[0]
second_largest = numbers[0]

for num in numbers:
    if num > largest:
        second_largest = largest
        largest = num
    elif num > second_largest and num != largest:
        second_largest = num

print("Second largest:", second_largest)
```

**Output:** `Second largest: 78`

**Explanation:**
- Keep track of both largest and second_largest
- When you find a new largest, old largest becomes second_largest
- 89 is largest, 78 is second largest

---

### Problem 9: Find Difference Between Max and Min
**Question:** Find the difference without using `max()` or `min()`.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]

# Find minimum
minimum = numbers[0]
for num in numbers:
    if num < minimum:
        minimum = num

# Find maximum
maximum = numbers[0]
for num in numbers:
    if num > maximum:
        maximum = num

# Calculate difference
difference = maximum - minimum

print("Difference:", difference)
```

**Output:** `Difference: 69`

**Explanation:**
- Find min: 9
- Find max: 78
- Difference: 78 - 9 = 69

---

## üìä Counting and Filtering

### Problem 10: Count Even and Odd
**Question:** Count how many numbers are even and how many are odd.

**Solution:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

even_count = 0
odd_count = 0

for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        even_count = even_count + 1
    else:
        odd_count = odd_count + 1

print("Even:", even_count)
print("Odd:", odd_count)
```

**Output:**
```
Even: 5
Odd: 5
```

**Explanation:**
- Use `%` operator to check remainder when dividing by 2
- If remainder is 0, number is even
- If remainder is 1, number is odd

---
