# Look-and-Say Sequence

## Details
The look-and-say sequence is a series of numbers where each term is generated by describing the previous term. Starting with '1', each subsequent term is constructed by reading off the digits of the previous term, counting the number of digits in groups of the same digit.

## Significance
The look-and-say sequence shows how simple counting rules can create complex patterns, using run-length encoding to describe each term. It is important for its growth rate, connections to combinatorics, and as an example in string processing and algorithm.

## Explanation
- Start with the number '1'.
- The next term is generated by describing the previous term:
    - For example, '1' is read as "one 1" → '11'.
    - '11' is read as "two 1s" → '21'.
    - '21' is read as "one 2, then one 1" → '1211'.
    - Continue this process for as many terms as needed.

## Example Walkthrough
| Term | Value    | Description                      |
|------|----------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | 1        | -                                |
| 2    | 11       | one 1                            |
| 3    | 21       | two 1s                           |
| 4    | 1211     | one 2, one 1                     |
| 5    | 111221   | one 1, one 2, two 1s             |
| 6    | 312211   | three 1s, two 2s, one 1          |

## Python Code
```python
def look_and_say(n):
    # Generate the first n terms of the look-and-say sequence.
    if n < 1:
        return []
    sequence = ['1']
    for _ in range(1, n):
        prev = sequence[-1]
        next_term = ''
        count = 1
        for i in range(1, len(prev)):
            if prev[i] == prev[i-1]:
                count += 1
            else:
                next_term += str(count) + prev[i-1]
                count = 1
        next_term += str(count) + prev[-1]
        sequence.append(next_term)
    return sequence

if __name__ == "__main__":
    n_terms = 6
    seq = look_and_say(n_terms)
    for idx, term in enumerate(seq, 1):
        print(f"Term {idx}: {term}")
