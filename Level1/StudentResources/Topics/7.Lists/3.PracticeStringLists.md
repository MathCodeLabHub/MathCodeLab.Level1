# üìù Practice: String Lists

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By completing these exercises, you will:
- Master working with string lists (words, names, sentences)
- Implement text processing and manipulation
- Develop algorithmic thinking for text data
- Learn to solve real-world text problems with lists

---

## üìã Instructions
- Write your own code without using built-in functions (unless specified)
- Use loops and conditional statements to solve each problem
- Remember: strings are case-sensitive (`"Apple"` ‚â† `"apple"`)
- Think about edge cases (empty lists, empty strings, special characters)

---

## üìö Basic String Operations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Count Total Characters
Count the total number of characters across all strings in a list.

**Example with Code:**
```python
words = ["cat", "dog", "bird"]

# Start with total = 0
total_chars = 0

# Loop through each word
for word in words:
    # Add the length of this word to total
    total_chars = total_chars + len(word)

print("Total characters:", total_chars)  # Output: 10
```

**How it works:**
```
Step 1: total_chars = 0
Step 2: word = "cat", len("cat") = 3, total_chars = 0 + 3 = 3
Step 3: word = "dog", len("dog") = 3, total_chars = 3 + 3 = 6
Step 4: word = "bird", len("bird") = 4, total_chars = 6 + 4 = 10
Result: 10 characters total
```

**Now You Try:**
```python
# Practice with these lists:
animals = ["elephant", "cat", "butterfly", "dog"]
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]
# Calculate total characters for each list
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Find Longest Word
Find the longest word in a list **without using `max()`**.

**Example with Code:**
```python
words = ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "butterfly"]

# Start with the first word as longest
longest_word = words[0]
longest_length = len(words[0])

# Check each word
for word in words:
    if len(word) > longest_length:
        longest_word = word
        longest_length = len(word)

print("Longest word:", longest_word)  # Output: butterfly
print("Length:", longest_length)      # Output: 10
```

**How it works:**
```
Start: longest_word = "cat", longest_length = 3
Check "cat": len = 3, not > 3, no change
Check "elephant": len = 8, 8 > 3, update longest_word = "elephant", longest_length = 8
Check "dog": len = 3, not > 8, no change
Check "butterfly": len = 10, 10 > 8, update longest_word = "butterfly", longest_length = 10
Result: "butterfly" is the longest
```

**Now You Try:**
```python
# Practice with these lists:
cities = ["Tokyo", "Paris", "New York", "LA"]
names = ["Alex", "Christopher", "Sam", "Elizabeth"]
# Find the longest word in each list
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Find Shortest Word
Find the shortest word in a list **without using `min()`**.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "butterfly"]
# Expected output: "cat" or "dog" (3 characters)
```

üí° **Hint:** Similar to finding the longest, but compare for smaller length.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Count Words by Length
Count how many words have exactly `n` characters.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["cat", "dog", "bird", "fish", "elephant"]
length = 4
# Expected output: 2 (bird and fish both have 4 letters)
```

üí° **Hint:** Use `if len(word) == length`.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

## üîç Searching and Filtering

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Check if Word Exists
Check if a specific word exists in the list using a loop (**not `in` keyword**).

**Example with Code:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]
search = "banana"

# Use a flag to track if found
found = False

# Loop through each fruit
for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == search:
        found = True

# Print result based on flag
if found:
    print(search, "found in the list")
else:
    print(search, "not found in the list")
```

**Output:** `banana found in the list`

**How it works:**
- Start with `found = False` (assume it's not there)
- Check each item in the list
- If we find a match, set `found = True`
- After the loop, check the flag and print the result

**Now You Try:**
```python
# Practice with these:
colors = ["red", "blue", "green", "yellow"]
search_color = "purple"  # Try with "blue" and "purple"
# Write code to check if search_color exists
```

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Count Occurrences of a Word
Count how many times a word appears **without using `.count()`**.

**Example:**
```python
colors = ["red", "blue", "red", "green", "red", "yellow"]
search = "red"
# Expected output: 3
```

üí° **Hint:** Use a counter and increment when you find a match.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Find Words Starting with a Letter
Find all words that start with a specific letter.

**Example with Code:**
```python
animals = ["cat", "dog", "cow", "chicken", "deer"]
letter = "c"

# Create empty list to store results
words_starting_with = []

# Loop through each animal
for animal in animals:
    # Check if first letter matches
    if animal[0] == letter:
        words_starting_with.append(animal)

print("Words starting with", letter, ":", words_starting_with)
```

**Output:** `Words starting with c : ['cat', 'cow', 'chicken']`

**How it works:**
```
Check "cat": cat[0] = 'c', matches! Add to list ‚Üí ['cat']
Check "dog": dog[0] = 'd', no match
Check "cow": cow[0] = 'c', matches! Add to list ‚Üí ['cat', 'cow']
Check "chicken": chicken[0] = 'c', matches! Add to list ‚Üí ['cat', 'cow', 'chicken']
Check "deer": deer[0] = 'd', no match
Result: ['cat', 'cow', 'chicken']
```

**Now You Try:**
```python
# Practice with these:
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Amanda", "Charlie", "Andrew"]
starting_letter = "A"
# Find all names starting with 'A'
```

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Find Words Ending with a Letter
Find all words that end with a specific letter.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["cat", "dog", "bat", "bird", "mat"]
letter = "t"
# Expected output: ["cat", "bat", "mat"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Use `word[-1] == letter` to check the last character.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Find Words Containing a Letter
Find all words that contain a specific letter anywhere.

**Example:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "grape", "orange"]
letter = "a"
# Expected output: ["apple", "banana", "grape", "orange"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Use a loop to check each character in the word.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### üîü Filter Words by Length Range
Find all words with length between `min_len` and `max_len` (inclusive).

**Example:**
```python
words = ["hi", "cat", "dog", "elephant", "bird", "butterfly"]
min_len = 3
max_len = 5
# Expected output: ["cat", "dog", "bird"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Use `if min_len <= len(word) <= max_len`.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

## üî§ String Transformations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Convert All to Uppercase
Create a new list with all words in uppercase.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
# Expected output: ["HELLO", "WORLD", "PYTHON"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Use `word.upper()` method.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Convert All to Lowercase
Create a new list with all words in lowercase.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["HELLO", "World", "PyThOn"]
# Expected output: ["hello", "world", "python"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Use `word.lower()` method.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Capitalize First Letter of Each Word
Create a new list with each word capitalized.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
# Expected output: ["Hello", "World", "Python"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Use `word.capitalize()` method.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£4Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse Each Word
Create a new list with each word reversed.

**Example with Code:**
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]

# Create empty list for reversed words
reversed_words = []

# Loop through each word
for word in words:
    # Reverse the word using slicing
    reversed_word = word[::-1]
    reversed_words.append(reversed_word)

print("Original:", words)
print("Reversed:", reversed_words)
```

**Output:**
```
Original: ['hello', 'world', 'python']
Reversed: ['olleh', 'dlrow', 'nohtyp']
```

**How it works:**
- `word[::-1]` is a slicing trick that reverses a string
- We create a new list and add each reversed word
- Original list stays unchanged

**Alternative Method (without slicing):**
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
reversed_words = []

for word in words:
    # Build reversed word character by character
    reversed_word = ""
    for i in range(len(word) - 1, -1, -1):
        reversed_word = reversed_word + word[i]
    reversed_words.append(reversed_word)

print("Reversed:", reversed_words)
```

**Now You Try:**
```python
# Practice with these:
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Reverse each fruit name
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Reverse the List Order
Reverse the order of words in the list **without using `reverse()` or slicing**.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Expected output: ["cherry", "banana", "apple"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Build a new list by inserting at the beginning or using negative indexes.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

## üìä Counting and Analysis

### 1Ô∏è‚É£6Ô∏è‚É£ Count Vowels in All Words
Count the total number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) across all words.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
# Expected output: 4 (e, o, o, o)
```

üí° **Hint:** Check each character against vowels list `['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']`.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£7Ô∏è‚É£ Count Words with Vowels Only
Count how many words contain only vowels.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["aaa", "hello", "ooo", "python", "eee"]
# Expected output: 3 (aaa, ooo, eee)
```

üí° **Hint:** Check if every character in the word is a vowel.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£8Ô∏è‚É£ Count Words with No Vowels
Count how many words contain no vowels at all.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["sky", "fly", "hello", "gym", "world"]
# Expected output: 3 (sky, fly, gym)
```

üí° **Hint:** Check if the word has no vowels.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£9Ô∏è‚É£ Find Most Common Word Length
Find which word length appears most frequently.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["cat", "dog", "bird", "fish", "ant", "bee"]
# Expected output: 3 (appears 4 times: cat, dog, ant, bee)
```

üí° **Hint:** Count occurrences of each length, then find the maximum.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

## üîÑ String Patterns

### 2Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Find Palindrome Words
Find all words that are palindromes (read the same forwards and backwards).

**Example with Code:**
```python
words = ["racecar", "hello", "level", "world", "noon"]

# Create empty list for palindromes
palindromes = []

# Check each word
for word in words:
    # Reverse the word
    reversed_word = word[::-1]
    
    # Compare original with reversed
    if word == reversed_word:
        palindromes.append(word)

print("Palindromes:", palindromes)
```

**Output:** `Palindromes: ['racecar', 'level', 'noon']`

**How it works:**
```
"racecar" reversed is "racecar" ‚Üí Same! Add to list
"hello" reversed is "olleh" ‚Üí Different, skip
"level" reversed is "level" ‚Üí Same! Add to list
"world" reversed is "dlrow" ‚Üí Different, skip
"noon" reversed is "noon" ‚Üí Same! Add to list
Result: ['racecar', 'level', 'noon']
```

**What's a palindrome?**
A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, like:
- "racecar" - r a c e c a r (same both ways!)
- "mom" - m o m
- "radar" - r a d a r

**Now You Try:**
```python
# Practice with these:
test_words = ["kayak", "python", "madam", "hello", "civic"]
# Find all palindromes
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Find Anagram Pairs
Check if two words are anagrams (contain the same letters in different order).

**Example:**
```python
word1 = "listen"
word2 = "silent"
# Expected output: True (they are anagrams)
```

üí° **Hint:** Sort the letters in both words and compare. Or count letter frequencies.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove Duplicate Words
Remove all duplicate words from a list **without using `set()`**.

**Example:**
```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana"]
# Expected output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

üí° **Hint:** Build a new list, only adding words that aren't already in it.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

## üéØ Advanced Challenges

### 2Ô∏è‚É£3Ô∏è‚É£ Join Words into Sentence

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£5Ô∏è‚É£ Count Unique Words

üí° **Hint:** Take the first character of each word and combine them.

**Your Solution:**
```python
# Write your code here
```

---

## üìä Testing Your Solutions

For each problem, test with these cases:
- ‚úÖ **Normal case**: Regular words
- ‚úÖ **Edge case**: Empty list `[]`, single word `["hello"]`
- ‚úÖ **Empty strings**: `["", "hello", ""]`
- ‚úÖ **Case sensitivity**: `["Apple", "APPLE", "apple"]`
- ‚úÖ **Special characters**: `["hello!", "world?"]`
- ‚úÖ **Numbers in strings**: `["hello123", "world456"]`
- ‚úÖ **Single characters**: `["a", "b", "c"]`

---

## üí° Common String Operations

| Operation | Method/Technique |
|-----------|------------------|
| **Get length** | `len(word)` |
| **First character** | `word[0]` |
| **Last character** | `word[-1]` |
| **Uppercase** | `word.upper()` |
| **Lowercase** | `word.lower()` |
| **Capitalize** | `word.capitalize()` |
| **Reverse** | `word[::-1]` |
| **Check character** | Loop through `for char in word:` |
| **Contains substring** | Loop and check or use `in` |

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways

‚úÖ Strings are sequences of characters  
‚úÖ Use `len()` to get string length  
‚úÖ Access characters with indexes like lists  
‚úÖ Strings are immutable (create new ones for changes)  
‚úÖ Case matters: "Apple" ‚â† "apple"  
‚úÖ Many string methods available (`.upper()`, `.lower()`, etc.)  
‚úÖ Loop through characters with `for char in word:`  
‚úÖ Build new strings character by character when needed

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

Practice these concepts:
1. Combine string operations with conditionals
2. Work with parallel lists (names and emails together)
3. Process real text data
4. Build text-based games or tools

Remember: **Text processing is everywhere** - in search engines, chatbots, data analysis, and more! üí™
