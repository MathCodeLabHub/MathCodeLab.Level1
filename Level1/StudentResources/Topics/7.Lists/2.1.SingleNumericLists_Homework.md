- Develop problem-solving skills and algorithmic thinking
- Understand how built-in functions work internally

---

- Use loops and conditional statements to solve each problem
- Test your code with different test cases
- Add comments to explain your logic

---

## 🔢 Practice Problems

### 1️⃣ Sum of Numbers in a List
Write a Python program to find the sum of all numbers in a list **without using `sum()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Output: 150
```

💡 **Hint:** Start with `total = 0` and add each number using a loop.

---

### 2️⃣ Minimum Number in a List
Write a program to find the smallest number in a list **without using `min()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]
# Output: 9
```

💡 **Hint:**
- Assume the first number is the smallest
- Compare each number one by one and update if you find a smaller one

---

### 3️⃣ Maximum Number in a List
Write a program to find the largest number in a list **without using `max()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]
# Output: 78
```

💡 **Hint:**
- Assume the first number is the largest
- Compare each number one by one and update if you find a bigger one

---

### 4️⃣ Count Even and Odd Numbers
Write a program to count how many numbers in a list are even and how many are odd.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Output: Even: 5, Odd: 5
```

💡 **Hint:** Use the `%` operator to check divisibility by 2.

---

### 5️⃣ Count Positive and Negative Numbers
Write a program to count how many numbers are positive and how many are negative.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [10, -5, 20, -15, 0, 30, -8]
# Output: Positive: 3, Negative: 3
```

💡 **Hint:** Check with `if num > 0` and `if num < 0`.

---

### 6️⃣ Find the Average of List Elements
Find the average value of all numbers in a list **without using `sum()` or `len()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Output: 30.0
```

💡 **Hint:** Use a loop to count elements and add them manually, then divide total by count.

---

### 7️⃣ Find Second Largest Number
Write a program to find the second largest number in a list **without using `sort()` or `max()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 56, 89]
# Output: 78 (second largest after 89)
```

💡 **Hint:** Use two variables — one for largest and one for second largest. Update while looping.

---

### 8️⃣ Reverse a List
Write a program to reverse a list **without using `reverse()` or slicing (`[::-1]`)**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

💡 **Hint:** Use a loop to build a new list by inserting each element at the beginning.

---

### 9️⃣ Find the Product of All Numbers
Write a program to find the product of all numbers in a list.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [2, 3, 4, 5]
# Output: 120 (2 × 3 × 4 × 5)
```

💡 **Hint:** Start with `product = 1` and multiply each number inside a loop.

---

### 🔟 Find the Difference Between Largest and Smallest
Write a program to find the difference between the largest and smallest number in the list — but do it **without using `max()` or `min()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]
# Output: 69 (78 - 9)
```

💡 **Hint:** First find both manually using loops, then subtract them.

---

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Find All Numbers Greater Than a Given Value
Ask the user for a number `x` and print all elements in the list greater than `x`.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [10, 25, 30, 15, 40, 5]
x = 20
# Output: [25, 30, 40]
```

💡 **Hint:** Use a loop and an `if` statement to check each number.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Check if a Number Exists in the List
Ask the user for a number and check if it exists in the list using a loop (**not `in` keyword**).

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [10, 25, 30, 15, 40]
search = 30
# Output: "30 exists in the list"
```

💡 **Hint:** Use a flag variable and a loop to search through the list.

---

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Count Occurrences of a Number
Ask the user for a number and count how many times it appears in a list **without using `.count()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [5, 10, 5, 20, 5, 30]
search = 5
# Output: 3
```

💡 **Hint:** Use a counter and increment it each time the number matches.

---

### 1️⃣4️⃣ Find Both Smallest and Largest in One Loop
Write a program to find both smallest and largest numbers in a list using a **single loop**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [45, 12, 78, 23, 9, 56]
# Output: Smallest: 9, Largest: 78
```

💡 **Hint:** Initialize both variables with the first element, then update both in the same loop.

---

### 1️⃣5️⃣ Swap First and Last Elements
Write a program to swap the first and last elements of a list.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Output: [50, 20, 30, 40, 10]
```

💡 **Hint:** Use temporary variables or tuple unpacking to swap values.

---

## 🌟 Bonus Challenges

### 🎁 Bonus 1: Remove Duplicates
Write a program to remove all duplicate elements from a list **without using `set()`**.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]
# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

### 🎁 Bonus 2: Find Common Elements Between Two Lists
Given two lists, find the elements that appear in both lists **without using `set()`**.

**Example:**
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
# Output: [4, 5]
```

---

### 🎁 Bonus 3: Rotate List by N Positions
Rotate a list to the right by `n` positions.

**Example:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
n = 2
# Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

---

## 📊 Testing Your Solutions

For each problem, test with these cases:
- ✅ **Normal case**: Regular input
- ✅ **Edge case**: Empty list, single element, all same values
- ✅ **Large numbers**: Test with bigger values
- ✅ **Negative numbers**: Include negative values where applicable

---

## 💡 Learning Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with problem 1 and work your way up
2. **Plan First**: Write pseudocode before coding
3. **Test Often**: Run your code after each problem
4. **Debug Smart**: Use print statements to see what's happening
5. **Compare Solutions**: After solving, think about other approaches
6. **Understand Why**: Don't just solve—understand how it works!
