Write small programs using only input() and print().

1. Ask for a friend's name and print it.
2. Ask for three favorite foods (ask three times) and print each one.
3. Ask: "Secret word?" then print it two times (two print lines).
4. Ask for a morning mood and an evening mood; print both, each on its own line.
5. Ask the user to type any sentence; first print the line: You typed: then print the sentence.
6. (Optional) Ask for a color and an animal; print the color, then print the animal.
