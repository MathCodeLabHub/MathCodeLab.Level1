## 1. Constraints First!

### What are Constraints?  
Constraints are **rules or limits** that tell us what values are acceptable in a system.  
- In real life: ‚ÄúYou must be at least 16 to ride this roller coaster.‚Äù  
- In math: ‚Äúx must be between 1 and 100.‚Äù  
- In programming: ‚ÄúPassword must be at least 8 characters.‚Äù  

They describe the boundaries within which everything works correctly.

### Why are Constraints Important?  
Constraints help keep our programs:  
‚úî Safe (they don‚Äôt allow wrong inputs)  
‚úî Correct (answers follow the rules)  
‚úî Fair and Predictable (everyone plays by the same rules)  

Without constraints:  
- An age of `-5` years doesn‚Äôt make sense.  
- A score of `200` in a game with max `100` would break fairness.  
- An empty password would not keep accounts safe.  

Just like classroom rules keep order, **constraints keep programs running smoothly**.

### How Do We Enforce Constraints?  
This is where **Conditional Statements** step in. They are like **gatekeepers** who check:  
- ‚ÄúDoes this input follow the rules?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúIf yes, what should we do? If no, what‚Äôs the correct response?‚Äù  

Example:
```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 0:
    print("Age cannot be negative.")   # Enforcing constraint
elif age < 18:
    print("You are not eligible to vote yet.")
else:
    print("You can vote!")
```

Here:  
- **Constraint:** `age >= 0`  
- **Conditional Statement:** `if age < 0` checks and blocks invalid input  
- **Flow:** Program continues only when the value follows the rules  

üëâ In short: **Constraints are the rules. Conditional statements are the tools to enforce them.**

## 2. Conditional Statements ‚Äì The Enforcers
Computers are patient helpers waiting for instructions. Conditional statements are their ‚Äúdecision goggles‚Äù that enforce your constraints by asking questions and choosing the correct path.

---
### 2.1 Single `if` (Optional Action)
Ask ONE question; maybe run ONE block.

Real life: "Is it raining?" If yes ‚Üí grab umbrella; otherwise continue.

### Example: Helmet Safety
```python
going_to_ride_bike = True   # Change to False to test

if going_to_ride_bike:
    print("Put on helmet")

print("Ready to go")
```
If condition is False the inside block is skipped.

### More Quick Examples
```python
raining = True
if raining:
    print("Take umbrella")
print("Leave house")

battery_low = False
if battery_low:
    print("Plug in charger")
print("Continue using device")
```
### Input Version
```python
answer = input("Did you finish your homework? (yes/no): ")
if answer == "yes":
    print("Great job! Free time now.")
print("Homework check complete.")
```
Try editing the prompt for other habits.

### Practice ‚Äì Single If
1. Ask: "Did you sleep well?" If yes print "Energy high!".
2. Ask: "Hungry?" If yes print a snack idea.
3. Ask: "Water bottle full?" If no (answer != "yes") print "Fill it".
4. Ask: "Backpack packed?" If no print "Pack it now".

---
### 2.2 `if / else` (Exactly One of Two Paths)
One question. ALWAYS take exactly one branch.

Pattern:
```python
if condition:
    # then branch
else:
    # else branch
```
### Example: Traffic Light
```python
color = input("Light color (red/green): ")
if color == "green":
    print("Go")
else:
    print("Stop")
```
### More Examples
```python
done = input("Chores finished? (yes/no): ")
if done == "yes":
    print("Snack time!")
else:
    print("Do chores first")

cold = input("Is it cold? (yes/no): ")
if cold == "yes":
    print("Wear jacket")
else:
    print("No jacket needed")
```

### Practice ‚Äì If / Else
1. Battery low? yes -> Charge now / else -> Keep using.
2. Friend online? yes -> Start chat / else -> Wait.
3. Shoes on? no -> Put on shoes / else -> Ready.

---
### 2.3 `if / elif / else` (Choose ONE of Many)
Top-to-bottom scan. First True branch runs; rest are skipped. Optional final `else` for "none matched".

Shape:
```python
if cond1:
    ...
elif cond2:
    ...
elif cond3:
    ...
else:
    ... # (only if nothing above matched)
```
### Example: Weather Outfit
```python
weather = input("Weather (sunny/cloudy/rainy): ")
if weather == "sunny":
    print("Wear sunglasses")
elif weather == "cloudy":
    print("Take a light jacket")
elif weather == "rainy":
    print("Grab an umbrella")
else:
    print("Check the forecast")
```
### More Examples
```python
time = input("Time (homework/brush/bed): ")
if time == "homework":
    print("Finish your assignments")
elif time == "brush":
    print("Brush your teeth")
elif time == "bed":
    print("Lights out. Sleep well")
else:
    print("Not in the plan")

meal = input("Meal (sandwich/pasta/salad): ")
if meal == "sandwich":
    print("Packing sandwich")
elif meal == "pasta":
    print("Serving pasta")
elif meal == "salad":
    print("Fresh salad ready")
else:
    print("Pick something from the list")
```
### Practice ‚Äì Elif Chains
1. After‚ÄëSchool Plan: homework/snack/play -> custom line; else -> Pick one plan.
2. Recess Activity: tag/swings/read -> action line; else -> Ask a teacher.
3. Favorite Subject: math/art/science -> fun title; else -> Great subject!

---
### 2.4 `match` (Structural / Exact Pattern Match) ‚Äì Python 3.10+
Modern alternative for checking ONE value against many patterns. Cleaner than large if/elif chains when comparing the same subject.

Shape:
```python
match value:
    case pattern1:
        ...
    case pattern2:
        ...
    case _:
        ...  # fallback
```
`_` is a wildcard (anything else). You can group with `|` and add guards `if ...` for ranges.

### Example: Day Greeting
```python
day = "mon"  # try: mon / tue / wed / fri / sat / sun
match day:
    case "mon":
        print("Monday boost: You got this!")
    case "tue":
        print("Tuesday: Keep rolling")
    case "wed":
        print("Mid-week high five")
    case "fri":
        print("Friday: Almost weekend!")
    case "sat" | "sun":
        print("Weekend mode: Relax")
    case _:
        print("Use a short day code (mon/tue/wed/fri/sat/sun)")
```
### More Examples
```python
mood = "curious"
match mood:
    case "happy":
        print("üòÄ Big smile!")
    case "bored":
        print("üòê Try a mini challenge")
    case "curious":
        print("ü§î Explore a fact page")
    case "tired":
        print("üò¥ Take a short break")
    case _:
        print("Mood not listed")

score = 78
match score:
    case s if s >= 90:
        print("Gold Badge")
    case s if s >= 75:
        print("Silver Badge")
    case s if s >= 60:
        print("Bronze Badge")
    case _:
        print("Practice Level ‚Äî keep going")
```
### When to Use vs If/Elif
Use `match` when: comparing one subject to many possible values / grouped values / value ranges.
Stick with `if` forms when: each branch tests unrelated conditions or multiple variables.

## 3. Real-Life Rules vs Python Constraints

> Using HTML `<br>` for line breaks keeps code readable inside table cells across most Markdown viewers.

| Real-Life Rule | Python Constraint | Example Code |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| **Finish homework before play** | `if homework_done:` | if homework_done:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Play time!")<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Finish homework first") |
| **Only drink water if bottle is full** | `if bottle_full:` | if bottle_full:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Drink water")<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Fill the bottle first") |
| **Ride allowed only if height ‚â• 120 cm** | `if height >= 120:` | if height >= 120:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("You can ride!")<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Too short for this ride") |
| **Password must be at least 8 characters** | `if len(password) >= 8:` | if len(password) >= 8:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Password accepted")<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Password too short") |
| **Game score cannot be negative** | `if score >= 0:` | if score >= 0:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Score recorded")<br>else:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;print("Invalid score") |

## 4. Quick Decision Pattern Cheat Sheet

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Enforce or check a constraint | `if` or `if / else` |
| Maybe do something | single `if` |
| Exactly one of two | `if / else` |
| One of many (first true) | `if / elif / else` |
| One of many (same subject) | `match` |
