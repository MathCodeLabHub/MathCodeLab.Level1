# Practice: Constraints and Conditional Statements ‚úÖ

Quick reminders:
- Constraints are the rules (what inputs/values are allowed).
- Conditionals (if / elif / else) enforce those rules and pick a path.
- Start simple. Read the code out loud as ‚Äúquestions and answers.‚Äù

## 1) Age Gate (No Negative Ages)
Question: Ask for age and say what kind of account they get.
Details:
- Constraint: age must be 0 or more (no negative ages)
- If age < 13 ‚Üí "Kid account"
- If 13..17 ‚Üí "Teen account"
- If 18+ ‚Üí "Adult account"
```python
age_text = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age_text)

if age < 0:
    print("Age cannot be negative.")
elif age < 13:
    print("Kid account created.")
elif age < 18:
    print("Teen account created.")
else:
    print("Adult account created.")
```
Try: What happens if you type -5? 12? 17? 25?

## 2) Score Must Be 0..100
Question: Read a score and make sure it follows the rules.
Details:
- Allowed range: 0..100
- Option A: Reject invalid values
- Option B: Clamp into the range
Two common ways: reject or clamp. Pick one.
```python
score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))

# A) Reject invalid
if score < 0 or score > 100:
    print("Invalid score. Must be 0..100.")
else:
    print("Score accepted:", score)
```
```python
score = int(input("Enter your score (0-100): "))

# B) Clamp into range
if score < 0:
    score = 0
elif score > 100:
    score = 100
print("Score (clamped):", score)
```
Which approach fits tests/exams vs. games?

## 3) Password Check (Minimum Length)
Question: Ask for a password and validate the length.
Details:
- Constraint: at least 8 characters
```python
password = input("Create a password: ")

if len(password) < 8:
    print("Too short. Use at least 8 characters.")
else:
    print("Password saved.")
```
Try: Count characters with your finger and check your guess.

---
## 4) Number Guess Range
Question: Ask for a guess and accept only if it‚Äôs in range.
Details:
- Valid range: 1..10
- Print a helpful message if out of range
Only accept guesses from 1 to 10.
```python
guess = int(input("Pick a number (1..10): "))

if 1 <= guess <= 10:
    print("Thanks. Valid guess:", guess)
else:
    print("Out of range. Try again.")
```
Bonus: Ask again if invalid (loop) once you learn loops.

---
## 5) Menu Choice (if / elif / else)
Question: Show a simple menu and do exactly one action.
Details:
- Choices: 1) Play, 2) Options, 3) Quit
- If choice is not 1/2/3 ‚Üí say it‚Äôs invalid
Exactly one path runs.
```python
print("Menu: 1) Play  2) Options  3) Quit")
choice = input("Choose 1/2/3: ")

if choice == "1":
    print("Starting game...")
elif choice == "2":
    print("Opening options...")
elif choice == "3":
    print("Goodbye!")
else:
    print("Invalid choice. Please pick 1, 2, or 3.")
```
Try: Add a secret choice "9" that prints ‚ÄúHidden Mode!‚Äù

---
## 6) Multiple Rules Together
Question: Check sign‚Äëup rules for name, age, and permission.
Details:
- Name must not be empty
- Age must be >= 0
- If age < 13, require parent permission == "yes"
Example: Sign‚Äëup form rules.
```python
name = input("Name: ")
age = int(input("Age: "))
parent_ok = input("Parent permission? (yes/no): ")

if len(name) == 0:
    print("Name required.")
elif age < 0:
    print("Age cannot be negative.")
elif age < 13 and parent_ok != "yes":
    print("Need parent permission for under 13.")
else:
    print("Signup complete! Welcome,", name)
```
Explain each rule to a partner like a referee reading the handbook.

---
## 7) Optional: match (Python 3.10+)
Question: Handle simple commands using pattern match.
Details:
- Commands: start / stop / pause
- Anything else ‚Üí "Unknown command"
Pattern match is like a clean switch‚Äëcase.
```python
command = input("Command (start/stop/pause): ")

match command:
    case "start":
        print("Starting...")
    case "stop":
        print("Stopping...")
    case "pause":
        print("Pausing...")
    case _:
        print("Unknown command.")
```
Use only if your Python is 3.10 or newer.

## Mini Challenges üß©
1) Temperature label: ask for a number; print "cold" if < 10, "warm" if 10..24, "hot" if ‚â• 25.
2) Triangle check: read three sides; reject if any side ‚â§ 0.
3) Game coins: input coins; if coins < 5 print "Not enough" else print "You can buy the item!".
4) Username rule: only accept usernames 3..12 characters long.

Tip: Say the rule first in plain words (constraint), then write the if/elif/else to enforce it.
