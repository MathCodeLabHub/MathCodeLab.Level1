# MCL.Level1.Loops – Puzzle-Based Programming Homework 🧩🐍

**Name:** _________________ **Date:** _________________

Get ready for some exciting programming puzzles! Each problem combines loops, conditions, data types, and operators in fun challenges. Show your work and write clean, readable code.

---

## 🔐 **Problem 1: Magic Number Lock (Constraints + Operators)**

**The Challenge:**
A mysterious treasure chest has a special lock! The chest opens only if you enter a number that follows this magic rule:

**🔑 Magic Rule:** The number must be divisible by **3 AND 5**, but **NOT by 2**.

**Your Mission:**
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user to enter a number
2. Checks if the number follows the magic rule
3. Tells the user if the treasure chest opens or stays locked

**Example:**
- Input: `15` → Output: "🎉 Treasure chest opens! 15 follows the magic rule!"
- Input: `30` → Output: "❌ Chest stays locked! 30 is divisible by 2."
- Input: `7` → Output: "❌ Chest stays locked! 7 doesn't follow the magic rule."

**Hints:**
- Use the `%` (modulo) operator to check divisibility
- A number is divisible by another if `number % divisor == 0`
- Combine conditions with `and` and `not`

**Write your code here:**
```python
# Your Magic Number Lock program










```

**Test your program with these numbers:** 15, 30, 45, 21, 75, 90

## ⭐ **Problem 2: Star Pyramid Challenge (Loops)**

**The Challenge:**
Build a beautiful star pyramid! Your program should create a pyramid pattern using stars (`*`).

**Your Mission:**
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user for the height of the pyramid (number of rows)
2. Prints a star pyramid with that many rows

**Example:** For input `n = 5`:
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

**Example:** For input `n = 3`:
```
*
**
***
```

**Hints:**
- Use a `for` loop to control the number of rows
- For each row, print the correct number of stars
- Row 1 has 1 star, row 2 has 2 stars, etc.

**Write your code here:**
```python
# Your Star Pyramid program










```

**🌟 Bonus Challenge:** Can you make a reverse pyramid or a diamond shape?

## 🔍 **Problem 3: Guess the Data Type (DataTypes)**

**The Challenge:**
Create a smart program that can identify what type of data the user enters!

**Your Mission:**
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user to enter something (anything!)
2. Analyzes what they entered
3. Tells them if it's an **integer**, **float**, or **string**

**Examples:**
- Input: `"42"` → Output: "That's an integer! 🔢"
- Input: `"3.14"` → Output: "That's a float! 🔢.🔢"
- Input: `"Hello"` → Output: "That's a string! 📝"
- Input: `"123.0"` → Output: "That's a float! 🔢.🔢"

**Hints:**
- Get input as a string first
- Try to convert it to different types using `int()` and `float()`
- Use try-except blocks to catch conversion errors
- Or use string methods like `.isdigit()` and check for decimal points

**Write your code here:**
```python
# Your Data Type Detective program










```

**Test with these inputs:** 42, 3.14, Hello, 123.0, -57, 0

## 🤖 **Problem 4: Robot Steps Puzzle (Loops + Constraints)**

**The Challenge:**
A friendly robot starts at position 0 and follows special movement rules!

**🤖 Robot Rules:**
- If the current step number is **odd**: robot moves **+3 steps forward**
- If the current step number is **even**: robot moves **+2 steps forward**

**Your Mission:**
Write a program that:
1. Asks the user how many moves the robot should make
2. Simulates each move following the robot rules
3. Shows the robot's position after each move
4. Prints the final position

**Example:** If user enters `n = 5`:
```
Move 1 (odd): +3 steps → Position: 3
Move 2 (even): +2 steps → Position: 5
Move 3 (odd): +3 steps → Position: 8
Move 4 (even): +2 steps → Position: 10
Move 5 (odd): +3 steps → Position: 13

🤖 Robot's final position: 13
```

**Hints:**
- Use a `for` loop to count the moves
- Check if the move number is odd or even using `% 2`
- Keep track of the robot's position in a variable
- Update the position after each move

**Write your code here:**
```python
# Your Robot Steps program










```

**Test with these values:** n = 3, n = 6, n = 10
