## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- ✅ Understand what programming is and why it's useful
- ✅ Work with variables to store and manipulate data
- ✅ Use different types of values (numbers, text, true/false)
- ✅ Perform mathematical operations and comparisons
- ✅ Make decisions in code using if-statements
- ✅ Create loops to repeat actions efficiently
- ✅ Write and use functions to organize code
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully
- ✅ Get input from users and display output
- ✅ Solve programming puzzles and challenges

## 🎮 What Makes This Course Special?

- **Engaging Analogies**: Programming concepts explained through games, stories, and real-world examples
- **Hands-on Learning**: Interactive code examples and practical exercises
- **Puzzle-Based Approach**: Learn through fun challenges and problem-solving
- **Age-Appropriate Content**: Designed specifically for young learners
- **Visual Learning**: Emoji-rich content and clear explanations

## Technical Setup

For teachers and parents:
1. Clone:
  ```bash
  git clone <repository-url>
  ```
2. Open in VS Code (optional: install Python extension)
3. Use the Concepts → Examples flow during live sessions
4. Encourage students to verbalize what changed after edits
5. Use answer keys for coaching, not just grading


## Tips for Success! 💡

1. **Be Curious!**
  - Change example code on purpose—predict the output first.
  - Run it. Were you right? If not, why?
2. **Practice Regularly**
  - Small daily reps > long weekly cram.
  - Finish homework before peeking at a key.
3. **Use Puzzles Strategically**
  - They should feel like “more of the same,” not “brand new.” If not, step back.
4. **Explain Out Loud**
  - If you can narrate each line’s job, you own it.
5. **Debug Mindset**
  - Change ONE thing. Re-run. Observe. Repeat.

Mentor Cue: Ask “What did you expect?” before giving hints.
