# Welcome to MathCodeLab Level 1! üöÄ

Hey there, future programmer! Welcome to an exciting journey into the world of coding. This repository contains everything you need to start your programming adventure with MathCodeLab Level 1!

## Our Learning Path üó∫Ô∏è

We've designed a fun, step-by-step way to learn programming:

1. **[Learn Concepts](StudentResources/Code/Concepts/)** ‚Üí **[Try Examples](StudentResources/Code/Examples/)** ‚Üí **[Do Homework](StudentResources/Homework/)** ‚Üí **[Solve Puzzles](StudentResources/Puzzles/)**

For example, when learning about operators:
1. First read [`Operators.md`](StudentResources/Code/Concepts/Operators.md) to understand the concept
2. Then try [`OperatorExamples.md`](StudentResources/Code/Examples/OperatorExamples.md) to see them in action
3. Complete the related [homework](StudentResources/Homework/) to practice
4. Finally, tackle a [puzzle](StudentResources/Puzzles/) using what you learned!

## What's Inside This Treasure Box? üíé

We've organized all the cool stuff into different folders to make it easy to find what you need:
